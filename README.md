## Debug Mode

Turning on the `DEBUG` flag will slow down the decompilation process significantly.
- **Performance Impact:** 0.000406s -> 0.002075s, around 5x slower

The `DEBUG` flag is meant for development purposes only. Turn off before using in production.

## Issues

- Makes everything a proto even if it isn't
  
- ~~Does not show jump targets (e.g., if code has `goto [5]` but only has 3 instructions, it doesn't show `::5::` and its dism)~~ (Fixed, but not implemented?)
-> May cause some complications though

- Decompile is broken/really bad/unfinished
- No type checking
- Does not handle variables kindly

Please contribute and fix these bugs and more that you may find
